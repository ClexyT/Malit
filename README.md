Malit - Restaurant Management Tool
Malit is a restaurant management tool created by a group of friends who are passionate about programming. The goal of this project is to test our knowledge in both frontend and backend development, while creating a useful tool for restaurant owners and managers.

The tool is designed to help restaurants with their day-to-day operations, such as managing orders, tracking inventory, and analyzing sales data. Malit is also designed to be easy to use, with a user-friendly interface that makes it simple for restaurant staff to learn and navigate.

Malit is still in development, and we are constantly working on new features and improvements. Our team is committed to providing the best possible experience for restaurant owners and managers, and we welcome feedback and suggestions from our users.
